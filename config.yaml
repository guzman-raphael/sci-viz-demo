                # DataJoint™ powered visualization that adapts to *your* workflows

                ![](https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/60e5a50c0632d17c36f6b2d3/1638463454411-SMVPVS9EBPLU9T9T5YMN/unsplash-image-Pyut03Gn98w.jpg?format=1000w)

                ## Features

                - Visualization that can **keep up with changing needs** of your lab
                - Standardized YAML build specification providing a **Low-Code web application
                  design** experience
                - Transport-optimization by leveraging **client-side rendering** with
                  [React](https://reactjs.org/)
                - **Python+[DataJoint](https://www.datajoint.org/) interoperability** to allow
                  streamlined integration
                - Clear separation between business logic from product features i.e. **customization
                  through configuration**
                - **Backend-optimized** page rendering built for big-data and scale
                - Comprehensive permission and security design enabling **flexible access control**
                  modes

                ## Component Library Types

                - `page`:
                  - Unique tabbed pages to separate areas within your single-page application
                  - Hidden pages accessible through linking from records in table components
                - `grid`: Layout structure for organizing subcomponents (as seen in
                  [Grafana, AWS Console](https://github.com/react-grid-layout/react-grid-layout#projects-using-react-grid-layout))
                  - `fixed`: For when you know exactly how many components you'd like to render
                  - `dynamic`: Component templating mode when you need to render realtime views that
                    vary in number of components
                - `table`: Sometimes there's nothing better than a table view
                  - paging
                  - sorting
                  - filtering
                  - font/backgrond highlighting
                - `metadata`: Great for showing context info for particular views
                - `plot`: Let's face it, we are going to need to be able to plot stuff
                  - plotly
                - `custom`: Adding new, custom components is easy with our extensibility hook. See
                  our currently supported components [here](https://github.com/jverswijver/pharus/blob/update_dynamic_api/pharus/component_interface.py)
                  which you can reference when creating your own.

                ## Acknowledgements

                We'd like to thank [internationalbrainlab.org](https://data.internationalbrainlab.org) for releasing
                publicly various sets of experimental workflow data. In order to provide a DEMO that
                seems more *relevant* we've used this public data to help grasp some of the concepts
                of what is currently supported in SciViz.

                ## Description

                Below is a summary of experimental session data from an acquisition system. The data
                set is certainly not in the realm of *big data* but there is sufficient records here
                to demonstrate the **backend-optimized** paging, sorting, and filtering. This is
                currently pointed to a live system so please feel free to try out the features and
                interact with the data.

                We've also configured font and background highlighting with the following rules:
                - Color the font in **RED** for the sessions where the subject is deceased.
                - Color the background in **YELLOW** if the session was started later than
                  `2020-09-01`.

                These rules along with configuring the backend query is entirely configurable
                using the standard spec file and DataJoint.

                Also, feel free to *click* below on a specific row of interest to be taken to the
                single-session, hidden page. Go ahead and checkout the session after applying the
                following filter:
                - `session_start_time='2020-09-21 19:02:17'`
                - `subject_uuid='70bf8cbd-d312-4654-a4ea-3a21ea2f541b'`

                ## Stored Plot Description

                Here we are looking to plot this session's reaction time over trial number. However,
                the source for this plot needs some manipulation which is perfect for the **custom
                component** feature.

                What is actually stored in DataJoint is a Plotly JSON with 2 series depicted on the
                left. The **gray** being the raw data and the **black** being its rolled data.
            session reaction time:
              route: /session_plot_query
              x: 0
              y: 2
              height: 3

                def dj_query(ibl_plotting_behavior):
                    return dict(query=ibl_plotting_behavior.SessionReactionTimeTrialNumber, fetch_args=['plotting_data'])

                ## Manipulated Plot Description

                It is fairly straightforward to achieve this manipulation by using the **custom
                component** feature.

                Within our specification in `SciViz.extra_components.config`, we can simply define
                a new component like so and utilize it here.

                ```python
                from pharus.component_interface import type_map, PlotPlotlyStoredjsonComponent

                class PlotPlotlyRemoveFirst(PlotPlotlyStoredjsonComponent):
                    def dj_query_route(self):
                        fetch_metadata = self.fetch_metadata
                        plotly_json = (fetch_metadata['query'] & self.restriction).fetch1(
                            *fetch_metadata['fetch_args'])
                        plotly_json['data'] = [plotly_json['data'][1]]
                        return plotly_json

                type_map = dict({'plot:plotly:remove_first': PlotPlotlyRemoveFirst}, **type_map)
                ```

                ## Description

                Let's suppose that you need a view to be more responsive to changing, realtime
                events. For instance, you'd like to see Psychometric curves for all newer
                sessions from 2 weeks ago (currently pinned to `2020-09-11`). This satisfies
                this by including both the metadata and the Psychometric curve for a given
                recent session.
